## Guidelines

### General

-   **Use links**, instead, to **redirect users to another page** of the current website or app, or to another website.
-   Avoid using too many buttons on a page. If many buttons are to be added, **less popular** or **less important** actions may be **grouped in a “more” button** (dropdown list) or **visually styled as isolated actions or links**.

### Labels

-   The button **label** should allow to **foresee what will happen** when clicking it.
-   Button **labels** should be **short** and use **“trigger words”**.
-   As much as possible, the **first word of the label** should be an **action verb** (e.g., the label for a button that allows the user to add a filter could be “Add Filter").

### Alterative Texts

-   When a **button includes only an icon** (no label), the **label** should be added in the **alternative text element in the HTML** and appear in a **tooltip** when the cursor is above the button.
-   An **icon with a label does not need alternative text**. In this case, the icon is a visual help to identify the purpose faster and filling it will cause a screen reader to repeat the text twice.

## Variations

The Button Type choice is defined by the function of the button (e.g. primary or a secondary action), the number of actions available in the screen (e.g. only one, two or more actions) and its location (e.g. displayed in a header, action bar, page or footer).

| Type      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary   | Primary Buttons are used to enable the most important actions, that is those that lead to the completion of the main task (e.g., Save, Continue, Submit), or strong call to actions. Ideally, there should be only one Primary Button per screen to avoid dilluting the user's attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Secondary | Secondary Buttons are used for main actions that users might want to execute but that are not in direct relation to the main task that is to be done in the screen or interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Combo     | The Combo Button got an attached drop menu because a choice of action has to be made (2 or more). They are usually used when one single action allows to create, delete or modify many different elements, which can be chosen in the dropdown list that appears on click. While using a combo button allows to avoid adding an extra step in the process, it can add friction to the user's decision making process if the options in the dropdown list are not intuitive enough to them. |
| Isolated  | Isolated Action Buttons are used for extra actions located on their own within an interface. Button borders and background color are removed to reduce the noise generated by the presence of many consecutive borders and surfaces, or to make it more discrete in the screen. The icon is optional and aims to help users identify the action faster. However, keep in mind that too many icons in a screen can be as distracting and confusing as too less.                             |
| Icon Only | Icon Only Buttons are used when there is a lack of space and a high density of content. This button type is preferably used to represent labels that are easily represented by an icon, such as the word "More".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
