## Guidelines

-   Avoid displaying more than one Child Form at a time for the same option set.
-   If the user navigates between options within the set, make sure to keep track of the previous values they entered in all Child Forms, so that they can retreive it if they reactive previous options. The unselected Child Form contents can be cleared once the form is saved.
