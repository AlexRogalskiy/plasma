## Guidelines

### Restrictions & Size

-   Users should be informed of any input restrictions such as character types or string lenght.
-   The text input width should give a hint on the expected size of the content to enter. Try to forsee the usual string length so as to avoid hiding parts of the entered strings. The text input field should be large enough to see the whole value in most cases.
-   Avoid setting a character limit or make sure to set it high enough to avoid constraining most user entry. If this is not possible, let users know how many characters are left.
-   Ensure that users can enter the information they need on a small screen.

### Behaviour

-   Show inline validation message after the user has finished interacting with the input.
