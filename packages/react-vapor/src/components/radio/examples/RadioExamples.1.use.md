## Guidelines

(See also: **Guidelines for All Form Controls** - _coming soon!_)

### General

-   A set should always have a title.
-   Use a wording that indicates that the user can select **only one option**. Some user may not know the difference between radio buttons and checkboxes.
-   Try to put the most common options at the top of the list, unless your options have a strong logical sorting order (such as prices or sizes).
-   Keep the set under 7 options to choose from.

### Label

-   Try to limit the size of the label to one short line.
-   Add a description or help hint only if necessary to explain the option.

### Behavior

-   Add a default preselected value using the recommended answer or, if there is none, the one most relevant to users.
-   Never use radio buttons if they are no answer possible in the set. The user **must** provide an answer to move on.
