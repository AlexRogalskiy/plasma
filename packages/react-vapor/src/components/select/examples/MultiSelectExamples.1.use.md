## Guidelines

### General

-   If space allows it and there are 7 or less options in total, consider using [checkboxes](#/components/Checkbox) instead.
-   Keep option label as short as possible to limit the control's width to a minimum.
-   When an option is selected, it should be removed from the option list.

### Options Sorting

-   Always put the most common items at the top of the list. If no options is to be selected more often than the others, use alphabetical or chronological order.

### Label

-   In most cases, there should be a label to identify the control.
