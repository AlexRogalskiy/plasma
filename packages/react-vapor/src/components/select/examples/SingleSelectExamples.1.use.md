## Guidelines

### General

-   If space allows it and there are 7 or less options to choose from, consider using [radio buttons](#/components/Radio) instead.
-   Use the shortest strings possible as option label so as to limit the control's width to a minimum.

### Options Sorting

-   Always put the most common items at the top of the list. If no options is to be selected more often than the others, use alphabetical or chronological order.

### Label

-   In most cases, there should be a label to identify the control.
