## Guidelines

### General

-   For binary settings, use a [slide toggle](#/styles/form-controls/slide-toggle), [toggle](#/components/FlatSelect) or [checkbox](#/components/Checkbox) instead.

### Labels

-   In most cases, Sliders should have a label.

-   Use the shortest value labels possible, ideally one word long (e.g. Low, Medium, High).

### Behavior and Layout

-   Adjust the size and behavior of the rail so that users have access to the precision level that they need, no more, no less.

-   Always place the smallest value on the left side and the largest on the right.

-   Snapping to evenly spaced tick marks along the rail may be enabled to help users select discrete values.

-   Discrete values should be selectable by clicking the value label.
