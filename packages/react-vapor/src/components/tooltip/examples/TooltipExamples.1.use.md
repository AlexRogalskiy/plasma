## Guidelines

### Do

-   Keep the **text short** and direct (about 3 lines maximum). For more detailed explaination, link to a documentation page.
-   Make Tooltips **appear over an empty space** in the screen or where it will hide the less relevant information.
-   Only show **one Tooltip at a time**.

### Don't

-   Don't use Tooltips to display **information that most users need** to accomplish their tasks. Use simple text instead.
-   Avoid adding Tooltips that display the same text as what **can already be read on the interface** (e.g. a Tooltip with "Print" as its content is not necessary on a button with the label “Print”).
-   Avoid using Tooltips to provide information about **an error or a warning**, as the need to hover an element to display its content will most probably hide important details that users might need.
