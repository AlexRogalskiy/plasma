# Best Practices

Use an actionable item when the actions are of secondary importance and there is no need to display them directly on the page.

An actionable item should always be prompted from a button.

An actionable item must be contextual and suited to the user's needs based on their selection.

Use the divider line to divide actions into logical groups.

## Labeling

- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Write for scannability
- Write the labels in sentence case and use verbs to indicate that an action will be taken
