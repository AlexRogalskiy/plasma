# Best Practices

Use an actionable item when the actions are of secondary importance and there is no need to display them directly on the page.

It should always be prompted from a button, from which it is associated.

The actionnables shown must be contextual and suited to the user needs based on its selection.

Use the divider line to divide actions into logical groups.

## Labeling
- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Write for scannability
- Write the labels in sentence case and use verbs to indicate that an action will be taken
