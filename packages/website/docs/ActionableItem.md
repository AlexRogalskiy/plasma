# Best practices
Use when the actions are secondary and there is no need to display them on the page itself.

It should always be prompted from a button, from which it is associated.

The actionnables shown must be contextual and suited to the user needs based on its selection.

Use the divider line to divide actions into logical groups.

## Labeling
- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Write for scannability
- Write the labels in sentence case and use verbs to indicate that an action will be taken
