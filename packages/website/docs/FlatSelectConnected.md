# Best Practices

A flat select allows users to select a single value among multiple options.

All options must have the same width.

Aim for five or less options.

The effect of the flat select must be immediately visible. For example, a display could change according to the user's selection. If not, consider using a drop-down menu, radio buttons, or checkboxes instead.

If used as view switcher (tabs), make sure it makes sense hierarchically and that tabs cannot be used.

## Labeling
- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Make option labels consistent and easy to scan.

## Flat Select and Tabs

The Flat select share similarities with various other components but here we try to clarify the difference between some of them.

## Flat select vs Tabs
Both are similar in appearance and designed for view switching on an element. Flat select are suitable for view switching within a pane, as where tabs, are used as a navigational control (Moving from screen to another).
