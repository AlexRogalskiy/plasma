# Best Practices

A flat select allows users to select a single value among multiple options.

All options must have the same width.

Aim for five or less options.

The effect of the flat select must be immediately visible. For example, a display could change according to the user's selection. If not, consider using a drop-down menu, radio buttons, or checkboxes instead.

If used as view switcher (tabs), make sure it makes sense hierarchically and that tabs cannot be used.

## Labeling
- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Write for scannability
