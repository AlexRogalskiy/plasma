# Best Practices

A flat select allows users to select a single value among multiple options.

The width of each of the options should be the same, we don't want any of the options feel more important than the other.

Aim for five or less options.

Don't use Flat select when the effect is not immediate, consider using dropdown menu, radio buttons or checkboxes instead. Users are expect to have immediate feedback on their actions when using Flat select.

If used as view switcher (tabs), make sure it makes sense hierarchically and that tabs cannot be used.

## Labeling
- Keep titles short, preferably **under three words**.
- Write for scannability

## Flat select vs Toggle switch vs Tabs
The Flat select share similarities with various other components but here we try to clarify the difference between some of them.

## Flat select vs Tabs
Both are similar in appearance and designed for view switching on an element. Flat select are suitable for view switching within a pane, as where tabs, are used as a navigational control (Moving from screen to another).
