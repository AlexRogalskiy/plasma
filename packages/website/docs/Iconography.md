# Logo use

Since Plasma is open-source, we shouldnâ€™t add any logos which are copyright due to the nature of public availability and the potential for misuse which we may be held responsible. Logos created by Coveo or are copyright free can be added to Plasma but for copyright logos, we must use the `svgChild` attribute and host the logo in a private repository.
